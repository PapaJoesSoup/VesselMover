Installation:
The folder containing these files ("VesselMover") should be in KSP's GameData folder.

Usage:
Open the vessel mover menu by clicking the icon on the toolbar.  Your vessel must be landed to use the move or spawn features.

Click move vessel to begin moving, and place vessel to set the vessel down where you want it.
